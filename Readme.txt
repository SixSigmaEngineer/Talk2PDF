#Aberdeen Advisors MultiPDF Chat Application

#Introduction
The Aberdeen Advisors MultiPDF Chat Application is a specialized tool built with Python that offers a unique interaction with your PDF documents. Using this app, you can naturally inquire about details or information found within the uploaded PDFs. Backed by a sophisticated language model, the application sifts through the content and supplies precise answers. However, keep in mind that it is designed to address queries specifically about the content within the uploaded documents.

#How It Works
To achieve its functionality, the application employs a sequence of operations:

PDF Loading: Multiple PDF documents are read, and the text contained within is extracted.

Text Chunking: This raw text is then segmented into manageable chunks, priming it for efficient processing.

Language Model Interaction: Vector representations (embeddings) of these chunks are generated using a language model.

Similarity Assessment: When you pose a question, the app evaluates it against these chunks, pinpointing the segments with the closest semantic resemblance.

Crafting a Response: These relevant segments are relayed back to the language model, which then curates a response based on the content of the documents.
